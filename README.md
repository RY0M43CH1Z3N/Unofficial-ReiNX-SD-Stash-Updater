# Unofficial-ReiNX-SD-Stash-Updater
*I am not endorsed by, nor affiliated with Reiswitched*.

A simple python program that fetches the latest ReiNX SD Stash assembled by Darth Meteos. This is designed for the computer, as many people would rather not connect their switch online (if you would like to download the files directly on your switch, look here https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/reinx-updater). This additionally includes [Custom Splash Script for ReiNX GUI](https://github.com/lunalik2/Custom-Splash-Script-for-ReiNX-GUI). Also, this can be easily altered to download other files. All credit goes to Rei, and the Reiswitched team for creating ReiNX, and it's splash screen.

## How to use:

1. Install Python 3.5 or later

2. Run setup.bat

3. Download Unofficial ReiNX SD Stash Updater, and run DownloadHost GUI.pyw

4. After about a second, Unofficial ReiNX SD Stash Updater should show you the latest stash

5. Under options, you may enable automatic deletion of the files once used

6. Under tools, you may also use the custom splash script ([instructions here](https://github.com/lunalik2/Custom-Splash-Script-for-ReiNX-GUI/blob/master/README.md))

7. Click "Download" to download the stash

8. Once the download finishes, you will be asked if you would like to automaticaly place the files on your SD card

9. If yes, choose the root of your SD card on the prompt

10. Enjoy your fresh files (under "about", you also find options to report a bug, join my discord, and join Rei's discord)
