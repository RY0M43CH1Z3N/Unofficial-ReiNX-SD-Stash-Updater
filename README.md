# Unofficial-ReiNX-SD-Stash-Updater
*I am not endorsed by, nor affiliated with Reiswitched*.

A simple python program that fetches the latest ReiNX SD Stash assembled by Darth Meteos. This is designed for the computer, as many people would rather not connect their switch online (if you would like to download the files directly on your switch, look here https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/reinx-updater). This is in a very simple state right now, but I have many features planned. Also, this can be easily altered to download other files.

How to use:

1. Install Python 3.0 or later

2. Install the requests module by typing 'pip install requests' in the command line

3. Download Unofficial ReiNX SD Stash Updater, and run DownloadHost.py

4. After about a second, it will tell you what the latest stash is

5. It now gives you a choice on whether to download or not, y proceeds with the install, n closes the program

6. Enjoy your fresh files
